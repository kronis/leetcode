The attached file is a word list, with one word per line. The task is to create a program that
finds all the words in the list that have one or more anagrams elsewhere in the list. These
should then be listed together with the original word. Not all words have an anagram, and you
should only find one-word anagrams.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)

Each line in the result should contain the words that are anagrams of each other. For example,
like this:
akte teak kate
aldri arild
aller ralle
alt tal
andre rande denar ander
.

With this task, we want to see how you solve programming challenges. You may chose the
programming language. In the interview, we would like you to go through your solution and
explain how you have solved it.
